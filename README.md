# SOM_algorithm_implemetation
SOM algorithm implementation on iris dataset

**Software Requirements**:  
- Any operating system with a modern web browser to access Google Colab (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.).
- Python 3.x is pre-installed in Google Colab.
- Required libraries include numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and minisom (which can be installed in Colab using `!pip install minisom`).
- Google account for using Google Colab.

**Hardware Requirements**:  
- No specific local hardware requirements as Google Colab provides free CPU resources and up to 12.72 GB of RAM.
- Internet connection to access Colab and run the code.
- Basic local storage for saving files (though Colab primarily uses cloud storage).

**EXECUTION**:
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account.
2. Create a new notebook.
3. Install the required library by running:  
   ```python
   !pip install minisom
   ```
4. Copy and paste the SOM code into a new cell.
5. Run each cell by clicking the play button next to it.
6. View the SOM output and clustered Iris dataset visualization.
7. Save the notebook in Google Drive or download it as a `.ipynb` or `.py` file.
